Main goal is to make code that does the following:
    - Has an API for clients to talk with 
    - Has a centralized management that lets you go to said client side pages 
    - Keeps track of status
    - Shows users what Pis they have the rights to view and edit 
        - Maybe work off of AD???
        - Hardcoded in the past
